-- History of Barbie

-- Barbie is a fashion doll created by American businesswoman Ruth Handler, manufactured by American toy
-- company Mattel and launched in 1959. Ruth Handler watched her daughter Barbara play with paper dolls, 
-- and noticed that she often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At the time, most children's toy dolls were 
-- representations of infants. Realizing that there could be a gap in the market, Handler suggested the idea
-- of an adult-bodied doll to her husband Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company.
-- He was unenthusiastic about the idea, as were Mattel's directors. During a trip to Europe in 1956 with her 
-- children Barbara and Kenneth, Ruth Handler came across a German toy doll called Bild Lilli. The 
-- adult-figured doll was exactly what Handler had in mind, so she purchased three of them. Upon her return to the 
-- United States, Handler redesigned the doll (with help from local inventor-designer Jack Ryan) and the 
-- doll was given a new name, Barbie, after Handler's daughter Barbara. The doll made its debut at the 
-- American International Toy Fair in New York City on March 9, 1959. This date is also used as 
-- Barbie's official birthday. 
-- The first Barbie doll wore a black-and-white zebra striped swimsuit and signature topknot ponytail, 
-- and was available as either a blonde or brunette. The doll was marketed as a "Teen-age Fashion Model", 
-- with her clothes created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte Johnson. The first Barbie dolls were 
-- manufactured in Japan, with their clothes hand-stitched by Japanese homeworkers. Around 350,000 Barbie 
-- dolls were sold during the first year of production.

Plot
Stereotypical Barbie and a wide range of fellow Barbies all reside in Barbieland, a matriarchal society 
where all women are self-confident, self-sufficient, and successful. While their Ken counterparts spend 
their days engaging in recreational activities at the beach, the Barbies hold all important job positions 
such as doctors, lawyers, and politicians. Beach Ken is only happy when he is with Barbie and seeks a 
closer relationship, but Barbie rebuffs him in favor of independence and female friendships.

During a dance party, Barbie is suddenly stricken with worries about mortality. The next day, she finds 
she can no longer complete her usual routine and discovers her feet have gone flat and she has cellulite. 
Weird Barbie, a wise but disfigured outcast, tells her that to cure her affliction, she must travel into 
the real world and find the child playing with her. On her way to the real world, Barbie finds Ken stowed 
away in her convertible, and reluctantly allows him to join her.

Arriving at Venice Beach, the two cause multiple antics and are arrested, alarming the Mattel CEO, who 
orders their capture. Barbie tracks down her owner, a tween girl named Sasha, who criticizes her for 
encouraging unrealistic beauty standards. Distraught, Barbie discovers that Gloria, a Mattel employee and 
Sasha's mother, is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with Sasha's Barbie toys 
while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Barbie. Gloria and 
Sasha rescue Barbie from Mattel's CEO and his subordinates, and the three travel together to Barbieland.

Meanwhile, Ken learns about the patriarchal system, and feels respected and accepted for the first time. 
Returning to Barbieland, he persuades the other Kens to take over, and the Barbies are subjugated into 
submissive roles, such as maids, housewives, and agreeable girlfriends. Barbie arrives and tries to 
convince Ken and the Barbies to return to the way things were, only to be rebuffed. She becomes depressed,
but Gloria gives her an inspirational speech about what it means to be a woman.

With the encouragement of Sasha, Gloria, Weird Barbie, Allan, and other discontinued dolls, the Barbies 
free themselves from the Kens and manipulate them to fight amongst themselves, allowing the Barbies to 
regain their positions of power and prevent the Kens from altering the constitution to enshrine male 
superiority. The Barbies also realize the error of their previous societal system, and decide to make 
some changes in Barbieland, including better treatment for the Kens and all outcast dolls.

Barbie and Ken apologize to each other and acknowledge their failings. Ken bemoans that he has no identity
or purpose without Barbie, to which Barbie encourages him to find an autonomous identity. Barbie, who 
remains unsure of her own purpose and identity, meets with the spirit of Mattel co-founder and Barbie 
inventor Ruth Handler, who explains that Barbie's story has no set ending and her ever-evolving history 
surpasses that of her roots.

Barbie decides to become human and return to the real world. Some time later, Gloria, her husband, and 
Sasha take Barbie, now going by the name "Barbara Handler", to her first gynecological appointment.
